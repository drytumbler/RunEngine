# RunEngine
up for recovery - remember I was heavily reworking this (before finishing, as always) when something called life came up..

started this as an(other) openGL testing framework for graphical applications / 3D rendering
basic python and lua scripting should be possible
really lost track of this one - has assimp model loader
was trying to render to a separate window and gui window using FBO's and ImGui but failed so far...
